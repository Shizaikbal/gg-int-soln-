[Interior design can be a complex and overwhelming process for individuals who lack professional expertise. Many people struggle to visualize how furniture and dÃ©cor will fit into their space, leading to dissatisfaction, wasted time, and costly mistakes. Traditional methods of designing a room layout often involve manual sketches, expensive consultations, or trial-and-error arrangements, which are inefficient and inaccessible to the general public.]
